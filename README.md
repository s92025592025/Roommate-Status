#Roommate Status

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>It is sometimes a awkward situation that when our roommate closed their door. We would never know whether they are not in the room, busy, or anything else. If you want to put a memo on the door, sometimes you will too busy to change the memo on the door. Since everyone now has either a phone or a computer with them, why not let the computer and phone do it for you? All you have to do is to print out a QR code on your door, and set up the triggers to change your status. Simple, direct, and your roommate will find out whether it is a good timing to knock on your door.</p>
